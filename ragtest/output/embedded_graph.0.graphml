Initially, Scrooge expresses disdain for Christmas, perceiving it as a time of financial burden and foolishness rather than joy.

Throughout the tale, Scrooge's journey is intricately linked to his relationship with Christmas, highlighting its significance in fostering kindness and community. The holiday acts as a catalyst for his transformation, as he is visited by the Ghosts during this crucial time of year. This experience leads him to embrace the spirit of giving and redemption, marking a significant shift in his perspective.
